Please input the number of simulations that you'd like the script to run. The higher the number of simulations, the more accurate the results. In general, 100,000 simulations is decently accurate and takes ~4 seconds to run. 1,000,000 simulations is about as accurate as it gets, but takes ~45 seconds to run. (This can vary heavily based on CPU speeds/number of cores)\
